# Solution for Big Data Storage and Querying

## Architectural Design

### 1. Storage Architecture
To efficiently store and manage log data, the following structures are proposed:

#### Distributed Storage:
- **Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS):** A distributed file system for big data processing.
- **Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage:** Cloud-based storage for high availability.
- Data is stored compressed using **gzip**.

#### Table Format:
Using columnar formats such as Apache Parquet or ORC improves query performance. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE logs (
    logType STRING,
    logId STRING,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    message STRING
)
STORED AS PARQUET;
```

#### Partitioning:
Log data is partitioned by `logType` and `date`. This allows queries to focus on specific log types and dates.
```sql
PARTITION BY (logType, date)
```

---

### 2. Data Processing Architecture
**Apache Spark** is recommended for query and data processing:

#### Batch Processing:
Historical logs stored in HDFS or S3 are processed using **Spark SQL**. For example, to query a week's worth of data:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM logs 
WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-07'
AND logType = 'firewall';
```

#### Indexing:
An **Elasticsearch** search engine is recommended to improve queryability of logs. Each log entry is indexed into Elasticsearch for fast querying:
```json
{
  "logId": "12345",
  "logType": "firewall",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:34:56",
  "message": "Log message here"
}
```

#### Streaming Processing:
For daily incoming logs, **Apache Kafka** or **Apache Flink** can be used for real-time analytics. Incoming logs are prioritized based on defined rules (e.g., SLAs).

---

### 3. Query Architecture
To meet SLA requirements:

#### Pre-Aggregation:
Daily or weekly summary data is created and stored in a separate table. For example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE weekly_summary AS
SELECT logType, COUNT(*) AS logCount
FROM logs
WHERE date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-07'
GROUP BY logType;
```

#### Query Optimization:
Query performance on Spark SQL is enhanced using techniques such as `broadcast join` and `predicate pushdown`. For example:
```sql
SET spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold = -1;
```

#### Caching:
Frequently used queries are cached on **Redis** or **Apache Ignite** for faster retrieval.

---

### 4. Disaster Recovery
To prevent downtime and data loss:

#### Data Replication:
Data is stored with 3 replicas on HDFS or S3. For example, for HDFS:
```xml
<property>
    <name>dfs.replication</name>
    <value>3</value>
</property>
```

#### Backup:
Weekly backups are stored on a cost-effective cloud solution like **Amazon Glacier**.

#### Failover:
**Apache Spark** operates in high availability mode. If a Spark Driver crashes, another driver is automatically activated.

---

### 5. Monitoring and Management
To monitor system performance and ensure SLA compliance:

#### Monitoring Tools:
- **Prometheus and Grafana:** Used to monitor Spark jobs, HDFS status, and Elasticsearch performance.

#### Alerting:
- Alerts are sent via email or SMS if queries exceed SLA thresholds or if a server fails.

## Pseudocode Example

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

# Create SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("BigDataLogProcessing") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Load daily logs
daily_logs = spark.read.format("parquet").load("/path/to/logs/2024-01-01")

# Create weekly summary
weekly_summary = daily_logs \
    .groupBy("logType") \
    .count() \
    .withColumnRenamed("count", "logCount")

# Save weekly summary data
weekly_summary.write.format("parquet").save("/path/to/summary/2024-week1")

# Send data to Elasticsearch
from elasticsearch import Elasticsearch

es = Elasticsearch([{"host": "localhost", "port": 9200}])
for row in daily_logs.collect():
    es.index(index="logs", id=row["logId"], body=row.asDict())
```

## Results
- **Storage**: Data is stored in a compressed and partitioned format using HDFS and Parquet.
- **Querying**: Elasticsearch enables fast querying, while Spark SQL handles large-scale data analysis.
- **Performance**: Pre-aggregation and partitioning techniques ensure fast results that comply with SLAs.
- **Resilience**: Data loss is prevented through HDFS replication and cloud-based backups.

This architecture is optimized for storing large log data and querying it efficiently within the given SLA requirements.
