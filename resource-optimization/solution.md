# Solution

## Architectural Design

### 1. Pipeline Prioritization and Queue Management
To execute pipelines in FIFO order, a "Priority Queue" or similar structure can be used:

**Queue Structure:**
- Pipelines are added to the FIFO queue.
- Pipelines are categorized as CPU-intensive or Memory-intensive.
- Pipelines are prioritized based on resource consumption (e.g., low-resource pipelines may have higher priority).

**Proposed Solution:**  
- Orchestration tools like Apache Airflow or Kubernetes Job Queue can be utilized. These tools are suitable for managing prioritized and scheduled tasks.

### 2. Spark Resource Management
To optimize Spark resources, resources should be allocated per pipeline:

**Dynamic Resource Allocation:**  
- Spark's Dynamic Allocation feature optimizes resource usage by creating as many executors as needed for each pipeline.
- `spark.executor.memory` and `spark.executor.cores` are dynamically set for each pipeline.

**Cluster Mode:**
- Spark runs in Cluster Mode, starting one Spark application per pipeline.
- Resources (CPU, RAM) are dynamically allocated using Kubernetes or YARN.

**Pipeline Differentiation:**
- High RAM is allocated for memory-intensive pipelines.
- Parallel processing is increased for CPU-intensive pipelines.

### 3. Disaster Recovery
To ensure uninterrupted operation and prevent data loss, a backup strategy should be implemented:

**Checkpointing:**
- Use Spark Checkpoint to save the state of each stage. Example:
  ```scala
  val checkpointDir = "/path/to/checkpoint"
  sparkContext.setCheckpointDir(checkpointDir)
  ```

**Backup and Restore:**
- Intermediate results are stored in distributed file systems like HDFS or Amazon S3.
- In case of failure, the pipeline resumes from the last checkpoint.

**High Availability (HA):**
- Spark Driver operates in High Availability mode on a Standalone Cluster or Kubernetes.
- The system automatically fails over if a master node or driver node crashes.

---

### 4. Performance Optimization
To balance concurrent pipeline execution and resource usage, the following methods are applied:

**Pipeline Parallelization:**
- A Rate Limiter is used to limit the number of simultaneous pipelines.
- Example: A maximum of 3 memory-intensive and 5 CPU-intensive pipelines can run concurrently.

**Resource Quota Management:**
- Resource quotas are defined per user. Example:
  - A maximum of 2 pipelines per user.
  - Memory and CPU limits for each pipeline.

**Task Scheduling:**
- Pipelines are scheduled to run at specific times using tools like Kubernetes CronJob.

---

### 5. Monitoring and Management
Monitoring tools are integrated to track system status:

- **Prometheus and Grafana**: Monitor CPU, memory, and IO usage of Spark applications.
- **Spark History Server**: Review past pipeline execution statuses.

## Pseudocode Example Solution

```python
from queue import PriorityQueue

# Define a Priority Queue for pipelines
pipeline_queue = PriorityQueue()

# Add pipelines to the queue (priority: 1 = high, 2 = medium, 3 = low)
pipeline_queue.put((1, "Pipeline1_CPU"))
pipeline_queue.put((2, "Pipeline2_Memory"))
pipeline_queue.put((1, "Pipeline3_CPU"))

# Process pipelines based on priority
while not pipeline_queue.empty():
    priority, pipeline = pipeline_queue.get()
    print(f"Processing {pipeline} with priority {priority}")
    # Dynamically allocate Spark resources for the pipeline
    if "Memory" in pipeline:
        # Allocate high memory resources
        spark_config = {
            "spark.executor.memory": "8g",
            "spark.executor.cores": 2
        }
    else:
        # Allocate high CPU resources
        spark_config = {
            "spark.executor.memory": "4g",
            "spark.executor.cores": 4
        }
    # Submit the pipeline with allocated resources
    submit_pipeline(pipeline, spark_config)
```

## Conclusion

- A queue structure was designed to manage FIFO order with prioritization.
- Spark resources were dynamically allocated to balance CPU- and memory-intensive pipelines.
- System resilience was ensured using Checkpointing and High Availability.
- Monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana improved system observability.

This design aims to achieve maximum performance with minimal resources while ensuring uninterrupted operation and ease of management.
